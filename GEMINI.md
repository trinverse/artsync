# Gemini Workspace Context

## Project Overview

This project is a static website for a company named ArtSync. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages. ArtSync provides services in three main areas: Software Development, Data Entry, and IT Support.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

To deploy the website to GitHub Pages, you will need to:

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  Push the code to the repository.
3.  Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

## Development Conventions

*   All custom styles should be placed in the `style.css` file.
*   All custom JavaScript should be placed in the `script.js` file.
*   The website should be responsive and work well on all screen sizes.
